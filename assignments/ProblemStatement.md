# Custom HTTP Server with advanced features

### Objective

    The goal of this assignment is to deepen your understanding of the http module in Node.js by creating a custom HTTP server with advanced features. You will demonstrate your knowledge of handling HTTP requests, responses, headers, routing, middleware, and error handling.

### Instructions

1. **Build the HTTP Server**:
    - Create an HTTP server using the http module.
    - Use the server to handle different types of HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
2. **Dynamic Routing**
    - Implement a custom routing system that can handle the following routes:
        - **/:** Respond with "Welcome to the Custom HTTP Server".
        - **/api/users**: Handle CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for a simulated user database.
            - Use an in-memory array to store user data.
            - Example user object: { id: 1, name: "John Doe", email: "<johndoe@example.com>"}.
        - **/files/:filename**: Serve static files from a public directory.
3. **Request Body Parsing**
    - Implement a request body parser to handle incoming JSON payloads for POST and PUT requests.
    - Parse the payload and update the in-memory data accordingly.
4. **Custom Middleware**
    - Implement a logging middleware that logs each request's method, URL, and timestamp to the console.
5. **Error Handling**
    - Handle invalid routes with a 404 Not Found response.
    - Gracefully handle server errors and return an appropriate error message (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error).
